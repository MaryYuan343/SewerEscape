# SewerEscape
A simple platformer game to navigate a sewer. In this game, you play as a little warrior mouse and attempt to escapt the sewer without falling into toxic water, poisonous spikes, and spiteful enemies. You will be able to jump, attack, and power attack once you have enough power. With these three simple moves, you can successfully traverse the treacheous sewers. Through clever manipulation of the controls and a sharp mind, escape is looking more and more possible. 
Here is how to play:
